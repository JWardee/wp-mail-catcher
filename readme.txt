== Description ==
Logging your mail will stop you from ever losing your emails again! This fast, lightweight plugin (under 140kb in size!) is also useful for debugging or backing up your messages.

Just install and activate then all of your contact form emails will be logged and saved to your DB with no additional configuration required.

View and manage all your form submissions through the default WordPress interface. An email failed to send? With a single click you can resend the backed up email.

Send emails out directly from the WordPress interface. Also includes support for attachments.

Immediately find out if your contact form submission was successfully sent.

## Features
* Zero setup required - just install and away you go
* Minimalistic - no overbloated features you never use weighing your site down - under 140kb in size!
* Bulk export emails to CSV for easy inclusion into Excel or any other program
* Compose new emails with the WordPress controls you're already familiar with
* Resend your emails in bulk
* Debugging - see exactly which file and code line was responsible for sending the email, along with any errors encountered
* Manage what user permissions can see the logs
* Routinely have your logs cleared out at a specified time - or keep them forever
* Need to be notified when there's a problem sending your mail? We've got hooks that allow you to do just that
* Completely free

## Hooks and actions
* `wp_mail_catcher_mail_success` is triggered when a message is sent and logged successfully. It has a single argument that is an array containing the log
  * `id` related to the id in the `mail_catcher_logs` MySQL table
  * `time` relative, readable time to when the log was saved
  * `email_to` the email address(es) that the message was sent to
  * `subject` the subject line of the message
  * `message` the contents of the message
  * `status` an integer depicting if the message was sent successfully or not (1 = sent successfully. 0 = sending failed)
  * `error` the error that occurred - if any
  * `backtrace_segment` a json_encoded object that shows which file and line the mail was initially triggered from
  * `attachments` a list of any attachments that were sent along with the email
  * `additional_headers` a list of any headers that were sent
  * `attachment_file_paths` a list of the location of any attachments that were sent
  * `timestamp` a unix timestamp of when the email was sent
  * `is_html` a boolean, that will be true if the message is a html email and false if not
  * `email_from` the from value of the email
* `wp_mail_catcher_mail_failed` is triggered when a message failed to send and logged successfully. It has a single argument that is an array containing the log (same as the arguments for `wp_mail_catcher_mail_success`)
* `wp_mail_catcher_deletion_intervals` is a filter that should return an array where each key is an amount of time in seconds, and the value is the label. Used to determine when a message has expired and should be deleted
